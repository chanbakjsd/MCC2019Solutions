# Answers for MCC 2019

In the root directory are my answers for MCC 2019. To run the program, you'll need the following:
- [Go](https://golang.org) (Used to program the solutions)
- A 64-bit computer (I can't be bothered to use int64 so it will probably overflow if you run it on a 32-bit computer)

## How to run the solutions:

Ascending:
```
go run ascending.go
```

Bakery:
```
go run bakery.go
```

Candy:
```
